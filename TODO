* Remove abuse of Show instances, use a CShow class or such for C formatting

* unifyDefs :: Dwarf -> [Def]

  * Concat all the definitions inside all the compilation units,
    unifying exactly equal ones, and prepending a compilation unit
    name to avoid collisions on the non-equal ones.

* This can later be used by an FFI package to generate the equivalent
  Haskell-types for each of the structs, unions, enums, and typedefs
  And the Binary and Storable instances
  And the Haskell FFI function declarations for each of the functions
